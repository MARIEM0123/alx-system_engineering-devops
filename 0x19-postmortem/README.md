Duration:
Start Time: February 16, 2024, 10:00 AM EST
End Time: February 16, 2024, 3:00 PM EST

Impact:
The outage affected our primary web application, rendering it inaccessible for approximately 5 hours. Users experienced an inability to log in, access content, or perform any actions within the application. Roughly 80% of our user base was affected.
Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was identified as a database connection issue stemming from a misconfigured firewall rule.
Timeline:
10:15 AM EST: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a sudden spike in database connection errors.
10:20 AM EST: Engineering team notified of the issue.
10:30 AM EST: Initial investigation focused on application logs and server health metrics to identify potential causes.
11:00 AM EST: Assumption made that the issue might be related to a recent code deployment.
11:30 AM EST: Deployment rollback attempted, but no resolution observed.
12:00 PM EST: Issue escalated to database administration team for further investigation.
1:00 PM EST: Database team identified misconfigured firewall rules blocking incoming connections.
2:30 PM EST: Firewall rules adjusted to allow proper database connections.
3:00 PM EST: Application services restored, and users regain access.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause:
The misconfigured firewall rules were blocking incoming connections to the database server, leading to a disruption in service.
Resolution:
The issue was resolved by adjusting the firewall rules to allow the necessary database connections from the application servers.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:
Implement regular audits of firewall configurations to prevent similar misconfigurations.
Enhance monitoring systems to provide more granular alerts for database connection issues.
Tasks:
Conduct a comprehensive review of all firewall rules to ensure alignment with security policies.
Implement automated tests for firewall configurations to detect misconfigurations promptly.
Enhance documentation regarding database server access requirements for better visibility and future reference.
Schedule regular training sessions for engineering teams to increase awareness of infrastructure-related issues and troubleshooting techniques.
By implementing these measures, we aim to minimize the likelihood of similar outages in the future and ensure the continued reliability and availability of our services.
